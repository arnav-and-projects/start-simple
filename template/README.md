- **`packages/frontend`**: React + Vite application. Builds to static `dist/`.
- **`packages/frontend-ssr`**: Express app that detects bots.
    - If **User**: Serves static files from `frontend/dist`.
    - If **Bot**: Launches Puppeteer, scrapes the locally running frontend, and returns full HTML.
